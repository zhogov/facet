"""Smoke test for ``api.database.get_async_db``.

Confirms the aiosqlite-backed helper opens a connection, applies the same
pragmas as the sync surface, returns Row-indexable results, and closes
cleanly. Required before migrating any endpoint to async — if these fail,
the larger conversion would fail with no clear signal.
