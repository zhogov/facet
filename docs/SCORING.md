# Scoring System

Facet uses a category-based scoring system where photos are automatically classified and scored with specialized weights.

## How Scoring Works

1. **Category Detection** - Photo analyzed for content (faces, tags, EXIF data)
2. **Filter Evaluation** - Categories evaluated in priority order until one matches
3. **Weight Application** - Category-specific weights applied to metrics
4. **Modifier Application** - Bonuses, penalties, and behavior flags applied
5. **Final Score** - Weighted sum clamped to 0-10 range

## Categories

Facet includes 17 built-in categories evaluated in priority order:

| Priority | Category | Detection Method |
|----------|----------|------------------|
| 5 | `art` | Tags: painting, statue, drawing, cartoon, anime |
| 10 | `astro` | Shutter > 10s AND luminance < 0.15 |
| 15 | `concert` | Tags: concert |
| 25 | `street` | Tags: street AND has face |
| 30 | `silhouette` | Has face AND is_silhouette |
| 35 | `group_portrait` | Face ratio > 5% AND multiple faces |
| 45 | `portrait` | Face ratio > 25%, not silhouette/group/mono |
| 50 | `human_others` | Has face AND face ratio < 5% |
| 55 | `macro` | Tags: macro, insect, butterfly, flower |
| 60 | `aerial` | Tags: aerial |
| 65 | `wildlife` | Tags: animal |
| 70 | `food` | Tags: food |
| 75 | `architecture` | Tags: architecture |
| 80 | `long_exposure` | Shutter 1-10 seconds |
| 85 | `night` | Luminance < 0.15 |
| 88 | `monochrome` | Saturation < 5% |
| 100 | `others` | Tags: landscape, mountain, beach, etc. (fallback) |

## Category Definition

Each category in `scoring_config.json` has these components:

```json
{
  "name": "portrait",
  "priority": 45,
  "filters": {
    "face_ratio_min": 0.25,
    "has_face": true,
    "is_silhouette": false,
    "is_group_portrait": false,
    "is_monochrome": false
  },
  "weights": {
    "aesthetic_percent": 61,
    "face_quality_percent": 3,
    "composition_percent": 7,
    "dynamic_range_percent": 6,
    "isolation_percent": 12,
    "leading_lines_percent": 4,
    "power_point_percent": 6,
    "saturation_percent": 1
  },
  "modifiers": {
    "bonus": 0.5,
    "_apply_blink_penalty": true
  },
  "tags": {}
}
```

## Weight Keys

All weights use `_percent` suffix and must sum to 100 per category.

| `aesthetic_percent` | Visual appeal | TOPIQ or CLIP+MLP | All |
| `face_quality_percent` | Face clarity | InsightFace | Portraits |
| `eye_sharpness_percent` | Eye sharpness | InsightFace landmarks | Portraits |
| `tech_sharpness_percent` | Overall sharpness | Laplacian variance | Landscapes |
| `composition_percent` | Composition | SAMP-Net or rule-based | All |
| `exposure_percent` | Exposure balance | Histogram analysis | All |

| `noise_percent` | Noise level | Noise estimation | Low-light |
| `face_sharpness_percent` | Face region sharpness | Face analysis | Portraits |
| `aesthetic_iaa_percent` | Artistic aesthetic merit | TOPIQ IAA (AVA-trained) | Art, creative |
| `face_quality_iqa_percent` | Face quality (IQA) | TOPIQ NR-Face | Portraits |
| `liqe_percent` | LIQE quality score | LIQE | Diagnostics |

| `bg_separation_percent` | Background separation | BiRefNet | Portraits, macro |

## Modifiers

Adjust scoring behavior per category:

| Modifier | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `bonus` | float | Added to final score (e.g., 0.5) |
| `noise_tolerance_multiplier` | float | Scale noise penalty (0.5 = half) |
| `iso_tolerance_multiplier` | float | Scale ISO penalty |
| `min_saturation_bonus` | float | Bonus for high saturation |
| `contrast_bonus` | float | Bonus for high contrast |
| `_skip_clipping_penalty` | bool | Skip exposure clipping penalty |
| `_skip_oversaturation_penalty` | bool | Skip oversaturation penalty |
| `_clipping_multiplier` | float | Scale clipping penalty |
| `_apply_blink_penalty` | bool | Apply blink detection penalty |

## Subject Saliency Dimensions

Four scoring dimensions derived from AI subject segmentation (BiRefNet). These measure how well the main subject stands out in the frame:

| Weight Key | Metric | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| `subject_sharpness_percent` | Subject sharpness | Compares focus quality between the subject region and the background. High values mean the subject is sharp while the background is soft. |
| `subject_prominence_percent` | Subject prominence | Ratio of subject area to total frame area. High for macro and tightly-framed subjects, low for wide scenes. |
| `subject_placement_percent` | Subject placement | Rule-of-thirds scoring for the subject's center of mass. Rewards subjects placed at power points rather than dead center. |
| `bg_separation_percent` | Background separation | Edge gradient difference at the subject boundary. Measures bokeh quality — how cleanly the subject separates from the background. |

Use `subject_sharpness_percent` and `bg_separation_percent` for portrait and wildlife categories where subject isolation matters. Use `subject_prominence_percent` for macro photography where the subject fills the frame.

## Supplementary IQA Dimensions

Three additional quality models that complement the primary aesthetic score:

| Weight Key | Model | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| `aesthetic_iaa_percent` | TOPIQ IAA | Trained on the AVA dataset to measure **artistic merit** — composition creativity, visual impact, emotional resonance. Differs from the primary aesthetic score which focuses on technical quality. Best for art, creative, and editorial categories. |
| `face_quality_iqa_percent` | TOPIQ NR-Face | Purpose-built **face quality** assessment. More accurate than generic quality models for evaluating face regions specifically. Best for portrait categories where face clarity is critical. |
| `liqe_percent` | LIQE | Outputs both a quality score and a **distortion diagnosis** (e.g., motion blur, overexposure, noise). Useful for understanding *why* a photo scores low, not just *that* it scores low. |

These models run automatically as part of the default scoring pipeline and share VRAM with the primary TOPIQ model. Add their weight keys to any category where the specialized assessment is valuable.

### Supplementary signals (not in default aggregate)

| Column | Source | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| `aesthetic_clip` | `analyzers/aesthetic_clip.py` + cached CLIP/SigLIP embedding | A free supplementary aesthetic score (0-10) derived from cached image embeddings by projecting onto an "aesthetic axis" built from positive/negative text prompts. Zero extra image inference at scan time. **Not** part of the default `aggregate`. Populate with `python scripts/compute_aesthetic_clip.py --db <path>`. Benchmark with `python scripts/benchmark_aesthetic.py --db <path> --ava AVA.txt --photo-dir <dir>`. AVA SRCC ≈ 0.52 on the 500-photo `ava_test/` set (vs 0.94 for `aesthetic_iaa`) — useful as a cheap pre-filter or when TOPIQ-IAA is unavailable. |

## Category Tags (CLIP Vocabulary)

Tags trigger tag-based categories and are matched using CLIP similarity:

```json
{
  "tags": {
    "landscape": ["landscape", "scenic view", "nature scene"],
    "mountain": ["mountain", "alpine", "peaks"],
    "beach": ["beach", "ocean", "seaside", "coastal"]
  }
}
```

Each key is the canonical tag name, and the array contains synonyms for CLIP matching.

## Top Picks Scoring

The viewer's "Top Picks" filter uses a custom weighted score:

```json
"top_picks_weights": {
  "aggregate_percent": 30,
  "aesthetic_percent": 28,
  "composition_percent": 18,
  "face_quality_percent": 24
}
```

**Score computation:**
- With face (face_ratio ≥ 20%): All four metrics contribute
- Without face: `face_quality_percent` redistributed to `aesthetic` and `composition`

## VRAM Profile Considerations

Default weights are optimized for **TOPIQ** (0.93 SRCC), the aesthetic model for all profiles.

| Profile | Aesthetic Model | Embeddings | Tagger | Recommendations |
|---------|-----------------|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| `24gb` | TOPIQ (0.93 SRCC) | SigLIP 2 NaFlex SO400M | Qwen3.5-4B | Best accuracy, default weights |
| `16gb` | TOPIQ (0.93 SRCC) | SigLIP 2 NaFlex SO400M | Qwen3.5-2B | Default weights |
| `8gb` | CLIP+MLP (0.76 SRCC) | CLIP ViT-L-14 | CLIP similarity | Default weights work well |
| `legacy` | CLIP+MLP on CPU | CLIP ViT-L-14 | CLIP similarity | Default weights, slower |

All profiles additionally run supplementary PyIQA models (TOPIQ IAA, TOPIQ NR-Face, LIQE) and optionally BiRefNet_dynamic for subject saliency.

Run `--compute-recommendations` after switching profiles to analyze score distributions.

## Weight Tuning Workflow

### Option A: Via Viewer (Recommended)

1. Open `/stats` → **Categories** tab → **Weights** sub-tab
2. Unlock edition mode
3. Select a category from the editor dropdown
4. Adjust sliders — the live **Score Distribution Preview** shows estimated impact
5. Click **Save** then **Recompute Scores** to apply

The viewer runs `--recompute-category` under the hood, updating only photos in that category.

### Option B: Via CLI

#### 1. Analyze Current Scores

```bash
python facet.py --compute-recommendations
```

Shows:
- Score distributions per category
- Weight correlation analysis
- Suggested adjustments

#### 2. Adjust Weights

Edit `scoring_config.json` category weights. Ensure they sum to 100.

#### 3. Recompute Scores

```bash
python facet.py --recompute-average               # All categories
python facet.py --recompute-category portrait      # Single category (faster)
```

Uses stored embeddings - no GPU needed.

#### 4. Validate Changes

```bash
python facet.py --compute-recommendations
```

Compare distributions before/after.

## Pairwise Comparison Mode

Train weights by comparing photo pairs:

### Setup

1. Set a non-empty `edition_password` in config: `"viewer": { "edition_password": "your-password" }`
2. Start viewer: `python viewer.py`
3. Click "Compare" button

### Comparison Interface

- Side-by-side photos
- Keyboard: A (left wins), B (right wins), T (tie), S (skip)
- Progress bar shows comparisons toward 50 minimum

### Weight Optimization

```bash
# Check comparison stats
python facet.py --comparison-stats

# Optimize weights from comparisons
python facet.py --optimize-weights

# Apply to all photos
python facet.py --recompute-average
```

### In-UI Weight Tuning

1. Open Weight Preview panel during comparison
2. Adjust sliders to see real-time score changes
3. Click "Suggest Weights" for optimized values
4. Manually update config

## Adding Custom Categories

```json
{
  "name": "underwater",
  "priority": 62,
  "filters": {
    "required_tags": ["underwater"],
    "tag_match_mode": "any"
  },
  "weights": {
    "aesthetic_percent": 40,
    "color_percent": 25,
    "composition_percent": 20,
    "exposure_percent": 15
  },
  "modifiers": {
    "noise_tolerance_multiplier": 0.3,
    "bonus": 0.5
  },
  "tags": {
    "underwater": ["underwater", "scuba", "diving", "ocean"],
    "fish": ["fish", "coral", "reef"]
  }
}
```

Add to the `categories` array in `scoring_config.json`, then run `--recompute-average` (or `--recompute-category underwater` for just the new category).

## Workflow Examples

### Tune Concert Category

```bash
# Edit scoring_config.json:
# Find "concert" category, adjust:
#   "noise_tolerance_multiplier": 0.05
#   "exposure_percent": 5

python facet.py --recompute-category concert
```

Or use the viewer's weight editor at `/stats` → Categories → Weights for live preview and one-click recompute.

### Switch to 8gb Profile

```bash
# Edit: "vram_profile": "8gb"
python facet.py --compute-recommendations  # Analyze
# Reduce aesthetic_percent in categories if needed
python facet.py --recompute-average
```

### Add Underwater Category

1. Add category definition (see above)
2. Run `python facet.py --validate-categories`
3. Run `python facet.py --recompute-average`
