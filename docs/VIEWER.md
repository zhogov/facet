# Web Viewer

FastAPI + Angular single-page application for browsing, filtering, and managing photos.

## Starting the Viewer

### Production

```bash
python viewer.py
# Open http://localhost:5000
```

This serves both the API and the pre-built Angular application on a single port.

For higher throughput (4 Uvicorn workers):

```bash
python viewer.py --production
```

### Development

Run the API server and Angular dev server separately:

```bash
# Terminal 1: API server
python viewer.py
# API available at http://localhost:5000

# Terminal 2: Angular dev server with hot reload
cd client && npx ng serve
# Open http://localhost:4200 (proxies API calls to :5000)
```

## Authentication

### Single-User Mode (Default)

Optional password protection via config:

```json
{
  "viewer": {
    "password": "your-password-here"
  }
}
```

When set, users must authenticate before accessing the viewer. An optional `edition_password` grants access to person management and comparison mode.

### Multi-User Mode

For family NAS scenarios where each member has private photo directories. Enabled by adding a `users` section to `scoring_config.json`:

```json
{
  "users": {
    "alice": {
      "password_hash": "salt_hex:dk_hex",
      "display_name": "Alice",
      "role": "superadmin",
      "directories": ["/volume1/Photos/Alice"]
    },
    "bob": {
      "password_hash": "salt_hex:dk_hex",
      "display_name": "Bob",
      "role": "user",
      "directories": ["/volume1/Photos/Bob"]
    },
    "shared_directories": [
      "/volume1/Photos/Family",
      "/volume1/Photos/Vacations"
    ]
  }
}
```

Users are created via CLI only (no registration UI):

```bash
python database.py --add-user alice --role superadmin --display-name "Alice"
```

See [Configuration](CONFIGURATION.md#users) for full reference.

### Roles

| Role | View own + shared | Rate/favorite | Manage persons/faces | Trigger scans |
|------|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| `user` | yes | yes | no | no |
| `admin` | yes | yes | yes | no |
| `superadmin` | yes | yes | yes | yes |

### Photo Visibility

Each user sees photos from their configured directories plus shared directories. Visibility is enforced across all endpoints: gallery, thumbnails, downloads, stats, filter options, and person pages.

### Per-User Ratings

In multi-user mode, star ratings, favorites, and rejected flags are stored per-user in the `user_preferences` table. Each user rates independently — Alice's favorites don't affect Bob's view.

To migrate existing single-user ratings:

```bash
python database.py --migrate-user-preferences --user alice
```

## Gallery Features

### Photo Cards

- Thumbnail with score badge
- Clickable tags for quick filtering
- Person avatars for recognized faces
- Category badge

### Multi-Select & Bulk Actions

- Click photos to select, Shift+Click for range selection
- Action bar appears with selection count and available actions
- **Favorite** — Mark all selected as favorite (clears rejected)
- **Reject** — Mark all selected as rejected (clears favorite and rating)
- **Rate** — Set star rating (1–5) for all selected, or clear rating
- **Copy filenames** — Copy selected filenames to clipboard
- **Download** — Download selected photos
- Clear selection with Escape or the Clear button

Bulk actions require edition mode. Double-click any photo to download it directly.

### Display Options

- **Layout Mode** - Switch between **Grid** (uniform cards) and **Mosaic** (justified rows preserving aspect ratios). Mosaic is desktop-only; mobile always uses grid.
- **Thumbnail Size** - Slider to adjust card/row height (120–400px, persisted in localStorage)
- **Hide Details** - Hide photo metadata on cards (grid mode only)
- **Hide Tooltip** - Disable the hover tooltip that shows photo details on desktop
- **Hide Blinks** - Filter out photos with detected blinks
- **Best of Burst** - Show only top-scored photo from each burst
- **Infinite Scroll** - Photos load as you scroll

### Similar Photos

Click the "Similar" button on any photo to choose a similarity mode:

- **Visual** (default) — pHash hamming distance (70%) + CLIP/SigLIP cosine similarity (30%). Falls back to CLIP-only when no pHash is available.
- **Color** — Histogram intersection (70%) + saturation distance (10%) + luminance distance (10%) + monochrome bonus (10%). Pre-filters by monochrome flag and saturation range.
- **Person** — Finds photos containing the same person(s). Uses `person_id` when available (fast), otherwise falls back to face embedding cosine similarity.

Use the **similarity threshold slider** (0–90%) to control how strict the matching is (not shown in person mode). The panel supports infinite scroll for large result sets.

### Filter Chips

Active filters shown as removable chips with counts at top of gallery.

## Person Management

### Person Filter

Dropdown shows persons with face thumbnails. Click to filter gallery.

### Person Gallery

Click person name to view all their photos at `/person/<id>`.

### Manage Persons Page

Access via header button or `/persons`:

| Action | How To |
|--------|--------|
| **Merge** | Select source person, click target, confirm |
| **Delete** | Click delete button on person card |
| **Rename** | Click person name to edit inline |

## Scan Trigger (Superadmin)

When `viewer.features.show_scan_button` is `true` and the user has `superadmin` role, a Scan button appears in the gallery header.

- Select directories to scan from the modal
- Scan runs as a background subprocess (`facet.py`)
- Only one scan at a time (global lock)
- Progress displayed in a terminal-style output area

This is useful when the viewer runs on the same machine that has GPU access for scoring.

## Semantic Search

Hybrid search combining CLIP/SigLIP embedding similarity (70%) with FTS5 BM25 text matching on captions and tags (30%). Type a query like "sunset over mountains" or "child playing in snow" and the viewer returns matching photos ranked by combined score.

- Requires stored `clip_embedding` data (computed during scoring)
- Uses sqlite-vec for KNN vector search when installed, falls back to in-memory NumPy
- FTS5 text search on AI captions/tags provides additional keyword matching (run `database.py --rebuild-fts` to enable)
- Uses the same embedding model as the active VRAM profile (SigLIP 2 for 16gb/24gb, CLIP ViT-L-14 for legacy/8gb)
- Controlled by `viewer.features.show_semantic_search` (default: `true`)

## Albums

Organize photos into named albums. Access via the `/albums` route.

### Manual Albums

Create albums and add photos from the gallery using multi-select. Albums support:
- Name and description
- Custom cover photo
- Custom ordering
- Browse album contents at `/album/:albumId`

### Smart Albums

Save a combination of filters (camera, tag, person, date range, score thresholds, etc.) as a smart album. Smart albums dynamically update as new photos match the saved filter criteria. The filter combination is stored as JSON in `smart_filter_json`.

### API

## AI Critique

Get a detailed breakdown of a photo's scores with strengths, weaknesses, and improvement suggestions.

### Rule-Based Critique

Available on all VRAM profiles. Analyzes stored metrics (aesthetic, composition, sharpness, face quality, etc.) and generates a structured explanation of why the photo scored the way it did.

### VLM Critique

Uses the configured VLM (Qwen3.5-2B or Qwen3.5-4B) to provide a richer, context-aware critique. Requires 16gb or 24gb VRAM profile and `viewer.features.show_vlm_critique: true`.

### API

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /api/critique?path=<photo_path>&mode=rule` | Rule-based score breakdown |
| `GET /api/critique?path=<photo_path>&mode=vlm` | VLM-powered critique (requires GPU) |

Controlled by `viewer.features.show_critique` (default: `true`) and `viewer.features.show_vlm_critique` (default: `false`).

## AI Captioning

Get an AI-generated natural language caption for any photo. Captions are generated on first request and cached in the `caption` database column. Captions can be edited manually in edition mode via the photo detail page.

### API

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /api/caption?path=<photo_path>` | Get or generate caption for a photo |
| `PUT /api/caption` | Update caption text (edition mode required) |

Also available via CLI for bulk generation and translation:

```bash
python facet.py --generate-captions      # Generate captions for all uncaptioned photos
python facet.py --translate-captions     # Translate captions to configured target language
```

Caption translation uses MarianMT (CPU, no GPU required). Configure the target language in `scoring_config.json` under `translation.target_language` (default: `"fr"`). Supported languages: French, German, Spanish, Italian.

Controlled by `viewer.features.show_captions` (default: `true`). Requires 16gb or 24gb VRAM profile for VLM-based captioning.

## Memories ("On This Day")

Browse photos taken on the same calendar date in previous years. A memories dialog shows a year-by-year retrospective of matching photos.

### API

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /api/memories?date=YYYY-MM-DD` | Get photos taken on this date in previous years |

Controlled by `viewer.features.show_memories` (default: `true`).

## Common workflows

- **Cull a vacation** — open Capsules → look for the auto-generated `journey` capsule for the trip dates. Each capsule offers a Save-as-Album action.
- **Walk a day-by-day review** — open Timeline → sort by aggregate → step through the year. Top shots float up first when you've enabled `hide_bursts` and `hide_duplicates` (defaults: on).
- **Show what's hidden** — the gallery hides blinks / non-lead bursts / non-lead duplicates by default. When at least one of those filters is on and would exclude rows, a "N photos hidden by current filters · Show all" banner appears above the grid.

## Timeline View

Chronological photo browser with date-based navigation. Scroll through photos organized by date with a sidebar showing available years and months.

### API

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /api/timeline?cursor=&limit=&direction=` | Paginated timeline photos with cursor-based navigation |
| `GET /api/timeline/dates?year=&month=` | Available dates for year/month navigation |

Access via the `/timeline` route. Controlled by `viewer.features.show_timeline` (default: `true`).

## Map View

View photos on an interactive map based on GPS coordinates extracted from EXIF data. Uses Leaflet for map rendering with clustering at different zoom levels.

### Setup

Extract GPS coordinates from existing photos:

```bash
python facet.py --extract-gps    # Extract GPS lat/lng from EXIF into database
```

GPS coordinates are also extracted automatically during scoring for new photos.

### API

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /api/photos/map?bounds=&zoom=&limit=` | Photos within map bounds (clustered by zoom) |
| `GET /api/photos/map/count` | Total count of geotagged photos |

Access via the `/map` route. Controlled by `viewer.features.show_map` (default: `true`).

## Capsules

Curated photo diaporamas (slideshows) grouped by theme. Access via the `/capsules` route.

### Capsule Types

Capsules are auto-generated from your library using multiple algorithms:

- **Journey** — trips detected via GPS clustering, with reverse-geocoded destination names ("Journey to Rome — March 2025")
- **Moments with [Person]** — best photos of each recognized person
- **Seasonal Palette** — photos grouped by season + year
- **Golden Collection** — top 1% by aggregate score
- **Color Story** — visually similar groups via CLIP embedding clustering
- **This Week, Years Ago** — extended "On This Day" across ±3 days
- **Location** — geotagged photo clusters with place names
- **Favorites** — favorited photos grouped by year and season
- **Dimension-based** — auto-generated from camera, lens, category, composition pattern, focal length range, time of day, star rating, and cross-dimensional combos

### Slideshow

Click any capsule card to start a slideshow. Features:
- **Themed transitions** — slide (journeys), zoom (portraits), kenburns (golden/seasonal), crossfade (default)
- **Auto-chaining** — when a capsule finishes, a transition card shows the next capsule before continuing
- **Shuffle & resume** — photos are shuffled for variety; resume position is tracked per capsule
- **Adaptive grouping** — portrait photos are grouped side-by-side based on viewport aspect ratio
- **Save as album** — save any capsule as a permanent album

### Freshness

Capsules rotate on a configurable schedule (default: 24 hours). Cover photos and seeded discovery capsules align to the same rotation period. The "Regenerate" button in the header forces an immediate refresh.

### Reverse Geocoding

Location and journey capsules show place names (e.g., "Paris, France") instead of coordinates. This uses offline geocoding via the `reverse_geocoder` package — no API calls needed. Results are cached in the database.

Install: `pip install reverse_geocoder`

### API

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /api/capsules` | Paginated capsule list (cached) |
| `GET /api/capsules/{id}/photos` | Photos for a specific capsule |
| `POST /api/capsules/{id}/save-album` | Save capsule as album (edition mode) |

### Configuration

See [Configuration — Capsules](CONFIGURATION.md#capsules) for all settings.

## Folders View

Browse your photo library by directory structure. Access via the `/folders` route.

- Breadcrumb navigation to move up the directory tree
- Each folder shows a cover photo (highest-scoring image in that directory)
- Click a folder to descend into it, or click a photo to open it in the gallery
- Respects multi-user directory visibility in multi-user mode

## GPS Filter Dialog

Filter photos by geographic location using an interactive map picker:

- Click the location filter button to open the map dialog
- Click or drag on the map to set a center point
- Adjust the radius slider to control the search area
- Photos within the selected radius are filtered into the gallery
- Requires GPS coordinates (run `--extract-gps` if photos have EXIF GPS data)

## Merge Suggestions

Find person clusters that may be the same individual. Access via `/merge-suggestions` or from the Manage Persons page.

- **Similarity threshold slider** — adjust how similar two persons must look to be suggested as a merge (lower = more suggestions, higher = more conservative)
- **One-click merge** — review each suggestion and merge with a single click
- **Batch merge** — select multiple suggestions and merge them all at once
- Also available via CLI: `python facet.py --suggest-person-merges`

## AI Culling (Similar Groups)

Find groups of visually similar photos across your library for culling. Unlike burst detection (which groups by time), similar groups use CLIP/SigLIP embedding similarity to find photos that look alike regardless of when they were taken.

Access via the similarity tab in the burst culling component.

### API

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /api/similar-groups?threshold=&page=&per_page=` | Paginated groups of visually similar photos |

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Slow page load | Run `--migrate-tags` and `--optimize` |
| Filters not showing | Check `--stats-info`, run `--refresh-stats` |
| Person filter empty | Run `--cluster-faces-incremental` |
| Compare button missing | Set a non-empty `edition_password` (single-user) or use `admin`/`superadmin` role (multi-user) |
| Password not working | Check `viewer.password` (single-user) or verify password hash (multi-user) |
| User can't see photos | Check `directories` in their user config and `shared_directories` |
| Scan button missing | Requires `superadmin` role and `viewer.features.show_scan_button: true` |
| Search returns no results | Ensure photos have `clip_embedding` data (run scoring first) |
| VLM critique unavailable | Requires 16gb/24gb VRAM profile and `viewer.features.show_vlm_critique: true` |
| Map shows no photos | Run `--extract-gps` to populate GPS columns, ensure photos have EXIF GPS data |
| Captions not generating | Requires 16gb/24gb VRAM profile for VLM captioning |
| Timeline empty | Ensure photos have `date_taken` values |
| Port 5000 in use | Change port in `viewer.py` or kill the conflicting process |
